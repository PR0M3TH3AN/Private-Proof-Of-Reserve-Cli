# Project Roadmap

This document outlines the current status of the Private Proof-of-Reserve CLI prototype and the recommended next steps.

## Overall assessment

| Aspect | What‚Äôs strong already | Gaps / caveats | Priority fixes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Privacy** | ‚Ä¢ Pedersen commitments hide individual UTXO values.<br>‚Ä¢ Bulletproof reveals only `total ‚Äì min ‚â• 0`.<br>‚Ä¢ Merkle root hides which UTXOs are included. | ‚Ä¢ Still leaks **count** of UTXOs.<br>‚Ä¢ Proof JSON exposes the commitment list. | ‚Ä¢ Consider batching commitments (e.g., hash-to-point of all UTXOs) to hide count. |
| **Security / key handling** | ‚Ä¢ PSBT round-trip keeps seeds on the hardware device.<br>‚Ä¢ Works for single-sig and (with spec) multisig.<br>‚Ä¢ No private data shown in CLI logs. | ‚Ä¢ Ownership-proof step not implemented yet.<br>‚Ä¢ Snapshot is current UTXO set‚Äîno guarantee it matches the declared height. | **High:** implement ownership-proof verification and snapshot-at-height. |
| **Reproducible builds** | ‚Ä¢ `Cargo.lock` committed again ‚Üí deterministic CI.<br>‚Ä¢ Clean `.gitignore`. | ‚Äî | ‚Äî |
| **Extensibility** | ‚Ä¢ CLI sub-command design is clean; easy to add `build-psbt`, `attach-sigs`.<br>‚Ä¢ Proof JSON is versioned. | ‚Ä¢ Versioning/upgrade path not encoded yet (add `"proof_format": 1`). | Medium. |
| **Usability** | ‚Ä¢ Works headless (`cargo run`) or with QR hardware.<br>‚Ä¢ Detailed README planned. | ‚Ä¢ Animated QR in terminal may be slow on some shells.<br>‚Ä¢ Need progress bars for large UTXO sets. | Low/Med. |
| **Performance** | ‚Ä¢ Pure Rust; no FFI headaches.<br>‚Ä¢ Commitment & Merkle root linear in UTXO count. | ‚Ä¢ Range-proof verification still `TODO` (Bulletproofs verify cost ~O(n log n)).<br>‚Ä¢ For thousands of UTXOs, QR frames explode. | Consider commitment aggregation. |
| **Compliance / auditability** | ‚Ä¢ Clear separation of cryptographic steps makes audit easier. | ‚Ä¢ Bulletproof gadget not audited; same for Merkle inclusion logic. | Engage external audit once code stabilizes. |

## Where we are right now

| Area | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Compiles & unit-tests** | ‚úÖ | All code builds with `--locked`; the three sanity-tests pass. |
| **CLI UX** | ‚úÖ | `generate`, `verify`, `build-psbt`, `attach-sigs` all run end-to-end (with a local Core node). |
| **Pedersen & Bulletproof plumbing** | ‚úÖ (prototype) | Commitments + range-proof verify correctly. |
| **UTXO gathering** | ‚ö†Ô∏è | Uses `listunspent` ‚Üí **current** UTXO set, not a historical snapshot at `height`. |
| **Ownership proof** | ‚õî | Currently just records the raw signature bytes; no validation logic. |
| **Merkle inclusion** | ‚õî | No membership paths; verifier re-hashes the full commitment list (trusts prover). |
| **PSBT flow** | ‚úÖ (MVP) | Draft PSBT is built, QR chunking works, signatures merged back. |
| **Security / audit trail** | ‚ö†Ô∏è | No domain-separation tags in transcripts, no zeroization of secrets, no formal review. |
| **Dependencies** | ‚ö†Ô∏è | Bulletproofs `4.x`, curve25519-dalek-ng `4.1`: both a year behind upstream. |
| **Test coverage** | üü° | Only 3 unit tests; no property tests, no integration tests. |
| **Docs / README** | ‚úÖ | High-level README, dev-setup instructions, and build badges present. |

## Should we keep going with this architecture?

Yes. Offline signing via PSBT leverages a mature ecosystem, and Pedersen commitments plus Bulletproofs follow well-tested cryptographic designs. The remaining features for multisig, descriptor wallets and snapshot-at-height do not require an architectural overhaul.

## Recommended next steps

| Priority | Task | Why it matters |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | **Historical snapshot** ‚Äì replace `listunspent` with a deterministic view at `block_height` (e.g. `gettxoutsetinfo` ‚Üí assumeUTXO or a pruned node halted at that height). | Prevents a prover from ‚Äúcheating‚Äù by spending after the snapshot. |
| **1** | **Ownership gadget** ‚Äì decide on a signature-verification strategy (Schnorr in-circuit vs. OP_RETURN PSBT anchor) and implement verification logic. | Without it you only prove that *someone* had those UTXOs. |
| **1** | **Inclusion proofs** ‚Äì emit Merkle branches, switch verifier to path-checking. | Makes the proof self-contained; verifier no longer has to trust the entire list. |
| **2** | **Upgrade deps** ‚Äì Bulletproofs `5.0`, dalek `4.1.4` (or switch to upstream non-ng). | Brings in subtle 3.0 API and fixes small-scalar bugs. |
| **2** | **Transcript domain separation** ‚Äì give each proof type its own label (`b"por-range"`, etc.). | Standard best practice to avoid cross-protocol attacks. |
| **2** | **Zeroize secrets** ‚Äì wipe blinding factors & PSBT bytes after use (`zeroize` crate). | Limits key-material leakage. |
| **3** | **Property / fuzz tests** ‚Äì proptest that any random set of UTXOs passes round-trip. | Hardens code against edge cases. |
| **3** | **CI matrix** ‚Äì run GitHub Actions on stable, beta, nightly; include `cargo audit`. | Keeps supply-chain and MSRV healthy. |
| **3** | **Multisig support** ‚Äì treat each PSBT input‚Äôs redeem script, gather all sigs, update ownership gadget. | Lets treasuries prove reserves without revealing co-signers. |

When these land the project should be a viable MVP for exchanges or treasury desks to trial on testnet.
